This is a prototype implementation of [the tree growing algorithm](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/colonization.egwnp2007.html) proposed by Runions, Lane, and Prusinkiewicz. It's also my first Coffeescript project and a change to try out the language.

Despite the best intentions, the code could use some polish. However, the algorithm works.
